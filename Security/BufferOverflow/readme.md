Buffer overruns have been recognized as a problem in low-level languages. The core problem is that user data and program flow control information are intermingled for the performance

A buffer overrun occurs when a program allows input to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer,

The effect of a buffer overrun is anything from a crash to the attacker gaining complete control of the application or control of the entire operating system and any otherusers who are currently logged on,or a network worm

C is the most common language used to create buffer overruns, closely followed by C++.
